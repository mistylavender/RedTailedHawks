## Sponsor's Words

[Sponsor Review Ticket](https://github.com/mistylavender/RedTailedHawks/issues/25)

- have a security feature between the student accounts and the website 
- have a way to upload the students artwork 
- be able to upload multimedia 
- have something to display the artwork on 
- have a small description on what Night of the Museum is about 
- each student should have a description for what their artwork is about 


**Checkup:** Thought that our idea was good and really liked the idea regarding that. Also thought that it would be good if we had 
the implementation of the notes and the uploads in order to make it easier for the teachers and students so that confusion 
would be reduced and the artwork would be directly uploaded onto the website. He also wanted to know if we would incorporate a 
security measure or feature within our website so that the student accounts can be managed. We told him about our tables and how we
planned to manage them with certain security precautions and agreed to that idea.
